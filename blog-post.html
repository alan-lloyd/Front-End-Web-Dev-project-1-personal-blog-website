        <h2>About the museum</h2>
          <p> Our museum galleries house wonderful historic and artistic objects both local and global - you can browse each gallery below.
          Our Sir John Madejski Art Gallery hosts a changing programme of temporary exhibitions for you to enjoy.</p>

          <p>Highlights include important archaeological finds from Roman Silchester and the nearby medieval Reading Abbey.
          There is also our unique Victorian copy of the Bayeux Tapestry and the famous Huntley & Palmers Ltd (a long-standing local business) biscuit tins.</p>

        <h2>Bayeux tapestry facsimile</h2>
          <p>View Britain's famous full-size Victorian version of the Bayeux Tapestry in its magnificent entirety.</p>

          <p>This faithful replica is 70 metres long. It was made by 35 skilled Victorian women embroiderers in 1885 and depicts the events leading up and includes to the Battle of Hastings in 1066.

        <h2>Silchester</h2>
          <p>This gallery features finds from the renowned collection of artefacts excavated at the Roman town of <em>Calleva Atrebatum</em> near Silchester.</p>

          <p>The Roman town lay largely undisturbed for over 1,000 years until large-scale excavations began in the 1860s. The finds included jewellery, fine glass and pottery, sculpture, mosaics, iron tools and coins.
          Fabulous objects of all kinds from the site are on display in the gallery.</p>

          <p>Visiting the gallery will reveal the home life of a wealthy citizen; the political and legal life of the Forum and Basilica; the social scene at the baths; and the shops, inns and workshops of the town.</p>
