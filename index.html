 <article class="home-pg-article" ><h2>Welcome to Reading Museum Blog!</h2>
 <p>Reading is a small town in England, about 30 miles west of London, that has had its fair share of history.</p>
 <p>Some historical artefacts are there for you to see in Reading Museum. It includes a room with local fossils, stuffed birds, and information how birds are faring locally nowadays, in a more urban environment.</p>
 <p>The museum includes things concerning the Roman 'town' of Silchester, now just fields near Reading, that has been studied by archeaologists for over a century.</p>
 <p>It also contains an excellent facsimile copy of the 'Bayeux tapestry', which outlined the Norman viewpoint regarding the invasion of England in 1066.</p>
 <p>This blogsite will include articles from contributors on interesting things it has to offer you.</p> </article>
